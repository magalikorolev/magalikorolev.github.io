👩‍🎓 I am a Master Student at École Normale Supérieure in Paris

⚛️ I am majoring in Quantum Physics

🌞 I am currently working on charge fractionalization in quantum wires at the Centre de Physique Théorique, École Polytechnique under the direction of Karyn Le Hur

🌈 In addition to my passion for sciences and physics, I enjoy drawing and painting with traditional and digital media, [see some of my art here](https://www.instagram.com/iromagz/).
